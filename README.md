# CLI ToolBox ⚙️

> A growing collection of powerful command-line tools, utilities, and scripts I've explored and turned out to be useful.

## 🔍 What's Inside?

This repo is a personal knowledge base where I:
- Document tools with real use-cases and example commands.
- Share hidden tricks and flags you probably missed.

## 📦 Tools Covered (so far)

- `yt-dlp` – advance video downloading
- `gallery-dl` - download image galleries and collections from huge list of websites
- `winget` - microsoft windows cli based application manager
- *...and many more coming soon.*

## 🧠 Why?

- Because the terminal is underrated.
